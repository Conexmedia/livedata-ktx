# livedata-ktx
Kotlin extension for LiveData, chaining like RxJava


# Getting Started

To add LiveData KTX to your project, add the following to your app module's build.gradle:

```groovy
implementation "me.henrytao:livedata-ktx:VERSION"
```

*(See latest version on top of README)*


# Usage


### Chaining LiveData

```kotlin
val liveData: MutableLiveData<Boolean> = MutableLiveData()
liveData
  .distinct()
  .filter { it == false }
  .map { true }
  .nonNull()
  .observe(lifecycleOwner, { result ->
    // result is non-null and always true
  })
```

### Remove observer

Because the input observer goes through a wrapper before it observes to source LiveData. So that you can't just simply remove it by just calling origin method `liveData.removeObserver`.
 
The new observe method returns `Removable` interface that allows you to remove observer effectively.  

```kotlin
val liveData: MutableLiveData<Boolean> = MutableLiveData()
val removable = liveData
  .nonNull()
  .observe(lifecycleOwner, {
    // TODO
  })
removable.removeObserver()
```
